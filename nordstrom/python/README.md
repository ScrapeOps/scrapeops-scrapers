## Installation  

### 1. Install Dependencies  
Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required dependencies:  

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

### 2.  Install ScrapeOps Proxy Service
The script uses the ScrapeOps proxy service for web scraping. You need an API key from ScrapeOps to use the service:

1. Visit [ScrapeOps](https://scrapeops.io/) and sign up for an API key.
2. You need to create a `config.json` file that contains your API key for the proxy service. Here's how your `config.json` should look:

```json
{
  "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY"
}
```

3. Replace "Replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your actual ScrapeOps API key.




### 3. Configure Product Search Parameters
In the `main` section of the script, you define the search query you want to scrape. 

Each keyword corresponds to a separate search query on the Nordstrom website.

You can customize the keywords you want to scrape in the `keyword_list` section of the script.  

For example:

```python
keyword_list = ["boots"]
```

You can also adjust the following parameters:

- `MAX_RETRIES`: Maximum number of retry attempts for failed HTTP requests.
- `MAX_THREADS`: Maximum number of threads that will run concurrently during the scraping process.
- `PAGES`: How many pages of search results to scrape for each keyword.
- `LOCATION`: The geographic location or country code for the scraping process.

```bash
python nordstrom_scraper.py
```

## Output Format
After the script finishes running, you should find CSV files generated for each keyword:

- **Product search data (boots.csv):** The product search CSV will contain information like the product name, price, image URL, and product URL.
- **Product review data (boots-reviews.csv):** The product review CSV will contain review data like the reviewer name, rating, and review details.
