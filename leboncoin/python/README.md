### 1. Install Dependencies  
Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required dependencies:  

```bash
pip install requests
```

### 2.  Install ScrapeOps Proxy Service
The script uses the ScrapeOps proxy service for web scraping. You need an API key from ScrapeOps to use the service:

1. Visit [ScrapeOps](https://scrapeops.io/) and sign up for an API key.

API_KEY = "YOUR-SUPER-SECRET-API-KEY"
```


### 3. Configure Product Search Parameters
In the `main` section of the script, you define the search query you want to scrape. 

To scrape a different product, update the line below. For example:

```python
keyword_list = ["ford mustang"]  # Change this to any product you want
```

You can also adjust the following parameters:

- `MAX_RETRIES`: Maximum number of retry attempts for failed HTTP requests.
- `MAX_THREADS`: Maximum number of threads that will run concurrently during the scraping process.
- `PAGES`: How many pages of search results to scrape for each keyword.
- `LOCATION`: The geographic location or country code for the scraping process.

## Output Format
The script generates CSV files containing the scraped data. There are two types of CSV files:

**1. Search Results Data (keyword.csv)**
- This file contains a list of vehicle listings found in the search results.
- The filename is based on the search keyword (e.g., ford-mustang.csv if the keyword is "Ford Mustang").

**2. Detailed Vehicle Data (vehicle_name.csv)**
- For each listing, the script extracts detailed data and saves it in a separate CSV file.
- The filename is based on the vehicle name extracted from the listing.
